A DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION FRAMEWORK FOR SIMULATIONS IN A DISTRIBUTED MANNER

-------------------------------- SETUP ---------------------------------------

To Setup follow the instructions in the Setup file 

-------------------------------- Requirements --------------------------------

The required libraries are included in the requirements.txt file

-------------------------------- Directory Sructure --------------------------

     ------------------------------ Fmus ----------------------------
     
Following contain the fmu's which are to be loaded in our program, choose from Model Exchange FMUs or Co-Simulation FMUs 

file/FMUs
    - CS.0
    - CS.1
    - ME.0
    - ME.1
    
    ------------------------------- Main Code -----------------------
    
SimulationCode/
     - Main.py 
     - Child.py
     - Master.py
     - bouncingball-log.txt
     
     The Main.py is the main file we have to run as discussed in the setup.py file
     Child is the child proces that master will run and master is the one that will controll child.py and save the results in the bouncingball_log.txt
